# GitHub Repositories Server

This is a very simple ExpressJS server that connects to GitHub's GraphQL API and outputs its data.

This approach was mostly used to obfuscate auth keys for the client side app (currently under construction).

### Note to self: when using Heroku...

    git add .
    git commit -m "..."
    git push origin master
    git push heroku master
